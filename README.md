# 2023 Year QUB Graduation Project PDF-Graph-Plotting
  A PDF file can be a plain text file and its specification is publicly available. Commands are available 
  to write text or graphics to different positions on a page. The purpose of this project is to 
  demonstrate the creation of a PDF file by plotting some basic graphs (as done by for example 
  gnuplot) both on a screen and to PDF. In the first instance a graph will be represented as a list of x 
  and y co-ordinates but the plotting of functions will also be investigated.
  It is anticipated that the software development will use Java but this is not a requirement.
